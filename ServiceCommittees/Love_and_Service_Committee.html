    <h3>Love and Service</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The purpose of the Love and Service Committee is to 
            help us love ourselves and others through service. 
            We promote service and provide information about service 
            to ensure the health of the A.A. community, the 
            continuance of the fellowship, and the effective 
            fulfillment of our primary purpose. We do this by 
            encouraging, sponsoring, and presenting workshops 
            and other activities.</li>
        <li>The Area Chair appoints the committee chair. Members are all 
            district Love and Service chairs and others with a desire to 
            promote our purpose; who are present at a meeting of the committee.</li>
        <li>All members are voting members within the committee.</li>
        <li>Changes in committee guidelines go to the Guidelines Committee 
            for referral to the Assembly if needed.</li>
        <li>A two-thirds (2/3) majority vote of the committee 
            is required for committee action.</li>
        <li>The outgoing committee chair will meet with the 
            newly appointed committee chair at the end of the two 
            year rotation to transfer all paperwork and update the 
            new chair on what the committee is doing.</li>
