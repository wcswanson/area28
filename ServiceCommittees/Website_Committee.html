    <h3>Purpose and Guidelines for the Website</h3>
    <h4>Purpose</h4>
    <p>
            This site is maintained by Area 28 Public Information Committee 
            General Service for the purpose of providing information to GSR&#39;s, 
            Area Committee Members, and other interested AA&#39;s within Area 28. 
            The site is maintained by members of Area 28.This site is maintained 
            through volunteer efforts and we only ask that information posted not 
            require frequent update.
    </p>
    <p>
        This needs updating to the current pdf:<br/>
        This site is in line with the April 1997 General Service PI conference action 
        where AA now includes &quot;Electronic Media&quot; as yet another method to carry the AA message.
        <br/><br/>
        We have read and are focused on the <a href="https://www.aa.org/assets/en_US/mg-18_internet.pdf" target="blank">A.A. Guidelines</a>
        for this website. As a result, this website is focused on Area 28. Any publication from aa.org will be 
        referred to their site. <br/><br/>
        <a href="https://aa.org/assets/en_US/smf-101_en.pdf" target="blank">FAQ</a> from the Service Material from the General Service Office.

            This site is not endorsed nor approved by Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, 
            Inc. or any given Internet Service Provider. It is an AA service solely 
            provided by the Area 28 General Service Website Committee. To adhere to our 
            tradition of personal anonymity, last names of AA members will not be listed 
            nor email addresses that include full last names. Some of the items at this 
            site may have been published by AA World Services, but do not assume that this 
            implies continued approval by the General Service Conference for their use.

            The Committee and Area also express thanks for the invaluable help of the Portland Central 
            Service Office. The CSO performs many valuable services including keeping the online meeting 
            lists current and listing events from throughout the Area. For the most current meeting list 
            for Downeast, Maine please visit <a href="http://meetings.downeastintergroup.org" target="blank">DowneastIntergroup.org.</a>

    <h4>Personal Anonymity and email</h4>
    <p>
            There is a very clear difference between posting last names on a website and using them within 
            an email or email address. A website is a public communication vehicle not unlike “Press, Radio, 
            and Films”. Carrying our AA message on a website or other media is within our traditions as long as 
            last names or facial pictures are not posted. 
    </p>
    <p>
            The Area Web page has taken great pains to ensure that last names are not used anywhere, 
            including within the website address. On the other hand, personal email between members 
            and/or non-members is no different than using the US Mail (snail mail) or telephone. 
            Disclosing AA membership in this way does compromise our tradition of maintaining anonymity 
            at the public level.

    <h3>Guidelines</h3>
    <p>
            The General Service Office has published <a>Need link</a>Guidelines on the Internet which we strive to follow. 
            Other than what&#39;s been covered, these will be established as needed.
    </p>
    <h3>Events</h3>
    <p>
            Events taking place in Area 28 are listed by the Portland Central Service Office.   
            They use the same criteria for including AA events as is used by the General 
            Service Office and the Grapevine: that the event is put on by AA members, 
            for AA members and about AA:
            <p>
                    Q. What are the criteria for listing A.A. conferences, conventions and similar events in Box 4-5-9 and the Grapevine?
            </p>
            <p>
                    A. G.S.O. defines an A.A. event as one put on by A.A.s, for A.A.s, about A.A. These events must be two or more days long. 
                    There would not be enough room to list one day events or group anniversaries. (BOX 459, GSO, February-March, 2008)
