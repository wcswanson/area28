    <h3>General Service Representative (GSR)</h3>
    <b>What is a GSR?</b><br/>
    <p>A General Service Representative (GSR) is the link between an AA group and AA as a whole.</p>
    <p>On page S26 of the AA Service Manual, we find: &quot;The GSR represents the voice of the group 
        conscience, reporting the group’s thoughts to the district committee member (DCM) and 
        to the delegate, who passes them on to the Conference.&quot;</p>
    <p>It is recommended that GSRs have at least two years of sobriety, time to commit to meetings, 
        and the ability to listen to differing points of view.</p>
    <hr/>
    <h3>Suggestions for new GSRs</h3> 
    <p>If your group is brand new, please complete a <a href="./pdfs/new-group-form.pdf" target="blank">new group form,</a>
        otherwise complete a GSR Change Form and send it to the Area registrar.</p>

    <h3>Group Resources</h3>
    <p>The single most important resource for Group guidance is the pamphlet, 
        <a href="https://www.aa.org/assets/en_US/p-16_theaagroup.pdf" target="blank">The AA Group.</a> 
        This may well be the most important pamphlet in AA. There is a copy [here ??]on the website.</p>
        <p>We suggest you get a printed copy. If you can’t find one, ask your District Chair for one.</p>
        <p>This pamphlet contains brief descriptions of various jobs and functions in groups as well as 
            suggestions for group meetings and questions to guide group inventories.</p>
        <p>Finances are often very confusing for Groups. There is excellent advice in the AA Group pamphlet. 
            There are also <a href="https://www.aa.org/assets/en_US/mg-15_finance.pdf" target="blank">
                GSO Guidelines on Finance</a> that are quite helpful for groups.</p>
        <p>Groups run their meetings many different ways. For a quick overview of AA parliamentary procedure used in most District and Area meetings, 
            see <a href="./pdfs/AA-Parliamentary-proc.pdf" target="blank">AA Parliamentary proceedure.</a></p>
        <p>One of the primary jobs of District Committee Members (DCMs) is to assist groups. Ask your DCM&#39;s for help. They will be 
            very excited to be asked and very willing to help. </p>
        <p>There are also Guidelines for most of the committees that Groups may have. Take a look at the Area Committee listings to find GSO 
            Guidelines and other links that may be helpful.</p>
        <p>Some Districts and Groups have found it helpful to have printed copies of the Tradition and Concept of the month and their checklists. 
            We have made these available for your use as <a href="#monthly">Monthly Handouts</a></p>
        <p>If you know of other links or suggestions that should be added to this page, 
            please tell us. Thanks.</p>
