    <h3>Public Information (PI)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The Public Information Committee is “responsible for creating greater 
            understanding of/and preventing misunderstandings of, the A.A. program 
            through the public media, electronic media, P.I. meetings, and speaking 
            to community groups.”</li>
        <li>The Chair of the Public Information Committee shall be appointed by 
            the Maine Area Chair following the Election Assembly in October and 
            serve a two-year term beginning in January of the following year.</li>
        <li>The Public Information Committee shall include District and Group P.I. 
            Chairs and any District or Group P.I. Committee members.</li>
        <li>The Area P.I. Committee Chair and District Chairs shall be responsible 
            for compiling lists of those willing to speak to community groups. 
            The lists from each district shall be provided to the Area Chair who 
            shall maintain and update the overall list which will be used to contact 
            AA members. The policy of the P.I. Committee shall be that AA members 
            will be asked to do speaking commitments in communities other than the 
            one in which they reside, recognizing the importance of anonymity.</li>
        <li>The Area P.I. Committee shall meet at all Area 28 Committee Meetings 
            (4 per year) and all Area 28 Assemblies.  The P.I. Chair may call a 
            special meeting if the need arises. </li>        
    </ul>

    <p>Since our guidelines suggest that school speakers come from districts, setting up 
        programs for students can be challenging. The area28 contact and coordinator to help 
        arrange speakers for schools is Mike L who can be reached at <b>PISchoolSpeakers@area28aa.org</b>.
        If you have a request for a school speaker or are trying to arrange a program for students, 
        please feel free to contact him for assistance.</p>
    <p>The PI Committee has an school initiative to form a link with and place literature 
        in every high school and middle school in Maine. Take a look at our initiative and 
        step-by-step guidelines to join this initiative:

    <p>Doing presentations is an important part of CPC and PI work. Here are some 
        <a href="http://wp.area28aa.org/wp-content/uploads/CPC-Presentation-Info-from-Workbook.pdf" target="#">
            Notes on Doing Presentations</a> from the CPC Workbook and a model/sample/template presentation 
            adapted for Area 28: in a PDF file for presentations. </p>
    <p>The PI Committee is working on a special <b>presentation for schools/young people</b>. 
        A draft copy is posted here for comments and suggestions. Please send your 
        ideas to Mike L at PISchoolSpeakers@area28aa.org. </p>
    <p>Anonymity is a major issue in doing both Public Information and Cooperation 
        with the Professional Community (CPC) work. The AA Pamphlet, 
        <a href="https://www.aa.org/assets/en_US/p-47_understandinganonymity.pdf" target="#">
            Understanding Anonymity</a>
         is an important resource and here is an excellent recent 
         <a href="http://wp.area28aa.org/wp-content/uploads/anonymity-article.pdf" target="#">
            article on anonymity</a>.
