    <h1>Request for Group Conscious</h1>
    <em>“Each member of Alcoholics Anonymous is but a small part of a great whole. A.A. 
        must continue to live or most of us will surely die. Hence our common welfare 
        comes first. But individual welfare follows close afterward.”</em>

    <h2>RE: How the Trusted Servant treat and respect other Trusted Servants and Volunteers</h2>
    <h3>Summary of Issues:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>I was appointed to do the website technical stuff by Gigi G and Bill L. At the Fall Assembly a Trusted Servant was using a document that I had uploaded. He made his displeasure towards my doing the website very clear.
        </li>
        <li>I was told that funds were available for the website but when I applied for reimbursement, I was met with an endless stream of requests. </li>
        <li>I sent an email to two Trusted Servants with my concern for safety in the Area 28 group as a result of the above experiences. No reply has been received.
        </li>
        <li>The most serious of all is that I have not been able to get any request for information for the website.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Details -- Issue 1:</h3>
    <p>
        From what Bill L tells me, the last web master said he was working on the
        <a href="http://area28temporary.website/" target="blank">new website</a> but no progress was being made. Also Bill L mentioned that the last web master said he made updates, but when Bill L checked on the updates, the updates were not there. At
        the fall assembly a Trusted Servant called me over to report an ‘issue’ on the website:
        <img class="container" src="./images/urlOld.png" alt="Old URL" width="505px" height="80px">
    </p>
    <p>
        He made it very clear that he would not have voted for me if he knew I was doing the downeastintergroup site as well. The only thing he would agree with me was that no one else has volunteered to do the website. He made his displeasure very clear. If
        he had asked me about the url and offered help to solve the url issue this issue would have been avoided.
    </p>
    <p>In an effort to keep people happy, I purchased another
        <a href="./images/url-receipt-aaarea28.pdf" target="blank">URL</a> (which is out of my pocket and will not be reimbursed because it will require too many resoureces) to use for the prototype website.
        <img class="container " src="../About/images/urlNew.png" alt="New URL" height="71px" width="478px"><br/>
    </p>
    <h3>Details -- Issue 2:</h3>
    <p>
        Another Trusted Servant told me that the expense for the website should not come out of my pocket and if I send in receipts I would be reimbursed. I did as requested. He responded that he needed a sentence or two to explain each expense. I did as he
        <a href="./images/Area28SummaryForExpenses.pdf" target="blank">requested</a> and divided the expenses out for the different projects to keep the expenses down. His response was that he disagreed and requested even more invasive information that
        is none of his business. Here is a quote from my report: “I will put the code for Area 28 up on GitHub after it is up and running.” Here is the response that I received: “Sorry for the delay replying to this message, unscheduled work has had me
        busy. I am not comfortable reimbursing the expenses you list at this time because the code your report provides for the GitHub is a downeast intergroup address and I don't see an area 28 address.” This shows that he did not read the report.
    </p>
    <p>
        If all the requirements that he is asking for are fulfilled, if they can be fulfilled, there will be no time or energy to work on the Area 28 website. The progress for the new website can be found at: <a href="http://aaarea28.org " target="blank "> aaarea28.org</a>        and this page can be found at <a href="http://aaarea28.org/About/About.html" target="blank">aaarea28.org/About.</a>
    </p>
    <h3>Details -- Issue 3:</h3>
    <p>
        I have emailed my concerns for doing the Area 28 to two Trusted Servants and have not heard from them, so this page is being printed and handed out to the Trusted Servants for a request for a group conscious.
    </p>
    <h3>Details -- Issue 4:</h3>
    <p>
        This gets to the most critical issue: <em>Getting information for the website.</em> Bill L is aware of my struggles and he is doing what he can to help. Nikki did send in the 2019 Workbook which was promptly used.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
    <p>
        In the process of doing research for the web site I have read and reviewed:<br/>
        <a href="https://aa.org/assets/en_US/smf-209_en.pdf" target="blank">Safety and AA: Our Common Welfare</a>,<br/>
        <a href="https://aa.org/assets/en_US/mg-18_internet.pdf" target="blank"> AA Guidelines Internet</a>,<br/>
        <a href="https://aa.org/assets/en_US/smf-101_en.pdf" target="blank"> Frequently Asked Questions About AA Websites</a> and<br/>
        <a href="https://aa.org/assets/en_US/smf-187_en.pdf " target="blank "> The Twelve Traditons of Alocohols Anonymous (long form)</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here are my conclusions from my research:
        <ol>
            <li>Each group is completely separate but participants can be involved in more than one group.</li>
            <li>Each group has its own conscious. It is up to the website committee to communicate the guidelines to the webmaster and what information should be on the site.</li>
            <li>The webmaster is technical and is time consuming so information and other matters affecting the website should go through the web committee.</li>
            <li>It is okay for the webmaster to be a paid position.</li>
            <li>The website committee should be the sole entity to communicate with the web master so that the web master tasks are clear and to provide resources so the web master can build and maintain the website without the added requirements of getting
                resources and information to build and maintain the site.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        So it is my conclusion that the website committee be responsible for getting the content to the webmaster and that the web site committee handle any reimbursements to the web master if any are provided. Five days after the February Area 28 meeting is
        my deadline to decide from the results of this request for a group consciousness if I will continued to do the Area 28 website.
    </p>
    <p>
        My code for the website can be found on <a href="https://github.com/wcswanson/area28" target="blank">GitHub</a> so the next webmaster can resume my work.

    <h3>About the Area 28 Website</h3>
    <p><b>From the webmaster (Last up date 12/3/19):</b> My hope and desire for this site is to provide a place where the Trusted Servants and Service Committees can share their resources to help those who are suffering from alcoholism. It is my understanding
        that real recovery will come when we move through the Cyber world into real human one-on-one relationships to help each other to recover from alcoholism. Dr Bob and Bill Wilson have stated that we need each other to recover. Likewise the website
        needs information from you to be useful, helpful, and to stay current. When AA first started, the internet did not exist. Times are changing and with the change of time, the rules of relationships are changing. In putting this site together, we
        are trying to keep the
        <a href="https://aa.org/pages/en_US/twelve-steps-and-twelve-traditions" target="blank">
        12 steps, 12 traditions</a>,
        <a href="https://www.aa.org/assets/en_us/mg-18_internet.pdf" target="blank">
        the aa.org website guidelines</a>, and the Area 28 group conscience in focus.
    </p>
    <p>Please consider doing a 12 step and send information to the web committee or the Boomerange. Those who recover well take an active part in their recovery. This means do something, not consume something&lt;gr&gt;.
    </p>
    <p><b>Note:</b>This webmaster has plans to post his experiences of recovery on his personal site.</p>
