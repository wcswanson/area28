    <h3>About the Area 28 Website</h3>
    <p><b>From the webmaster (Last up date 12/3/19):</b>
        My hope and desire for this site is to provide a place where the Trusted Servants 
        and Service Committees can share their resources to help those who are suffering 
        from alcoholism. It is my understanding that real recovery will come when we move 
        through the Cyber world into real human one-on-one relationships to help each other 
        to recover from alcoholism. Dr Bob and Bill Wilson have stated that we need each 
        other to recover. Likewise the website needs information from you to be useful, 
        helpful, and to stay current. When AA first started, the internet did not exist. 
        Times are changing and with the change of time, the rules of relationships are 
        changing. In putting this site together, we are trying to keep the 
        <a href="https://aa.org/pages/en_US/twelve-steps-and-twelve-traditions" target="blank">
        12 steps, 12 traditions</a>, 
        <a href="https://www.aa.org/assets/en_us/mg-18_internet.pdf" target="blank">
        the aa.org website guidelines</a>, and the Area 28 group conscience in focus.                 
    </p>
    <p>Please consider doing a 12 step and send information to the web committee or 
        the Boomerange. Those who recover well take an active part in their recovery. 
        This means do something, not consume something&lt;gr&gt;.          
    </p>
    <p><b>Note:</b>This webmaster has plans to post his experiences of recovery on his personal site.</p>
